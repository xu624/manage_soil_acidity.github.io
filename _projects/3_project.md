### INTRODUCTION
The disconnection between livestock and arable production systems has resulted in highly elevated nutrient losses to the environment (1). Recycling organic manure can simultaneously reduce nutrient losses and soil acidification in croplands (2). However, the required amount of manure to counteract acidification may lead to an overuse of phosphorus (P) (3). It is therefore essential to design an optimal soil and fertiliser strategy by combining mineral fertilizer, manure and lime to improve soil health and crop production (Fig. 1) while accounting for spatial variation in soil and other agroecosystem properties.

### METHODS
n this study, we assessed optimal manure recycling rates in combination with N and P fertilizer application, minimizing N and P surpluses and soil acidification rates (lime requirements), at 151 sites in Qiyang, a typical Chinese county, while extrapolating results to county-level with the acidification model VSD+. 

### RESULTS
Results show that historical acidification in croplands was mainly driven by bicarbonate leaching in paddy soils and by N transformations in upland soils, while crop removal was the second most important driver in both soils. In upland soils, bicarbonate input from organic manure partly neutralized acid production (see results of topic 2), but it was limited since only 28% of the BC excreted by humans and animals had been recycled. 

Balancing N and P input with crop demand and an optimized recycling rate of organic manure (BNPR scenario) can fulfill all crop requirements with minimum adverse impacts on soil quality and the environment. Recycling 90% of potentially available manure to both calcareous and non-calcareous soils with the N and P surpluses declining by 70 to 90% among all croplands, and the lime requirement for non-calcareous soils declining by 50%. Spatial analysis shows that the decreases in N and P surplus mainly located in northern and southern areas.

NOTE: Figures are not shown as this work is ongoing. We will update soon after its publishment.
