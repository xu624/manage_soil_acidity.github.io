### INTRODUCTION
Naturally, soil acidification is slowly driven by the net leaching of bicarbonate ($$HCO_3$$) and organic acid accompanying with base cations ($$BC$$), when excess precipitation occurs (1). In croplands, application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers, especially ammonium-based ($$NH_4$$) fertilizers, increases acid production via nitrification and the leaching of nitrate ($$NO_3$$) along with $$BC$$ (2). Continuous $$BC$$ removal by crops also leads to soil acidification (3). Identifying the main drivers is essential to mitigate soil acidification.

### METHODS
In this topic, we calibrated the combined nutrient and soil acidification model VSD+ (4) based on the historical changes in cropland acidification rates and their drivers for the period 1985-2019 at 151 sites, including paddy soils and upland soils, in a typical Chinese county naming Qiyang.

### RESULTS
Results show that, in non-calcareous soils, the acidity production was mainly driven by a pH-induced reduction in $$HCO_3$$ leaching and N transformations in paddy soils. In upland soils, however, acidity production was mainly driven by N transformations and hardly changed over time (Figure 3a). In calcareous soils, $$HCO_3$$ leaching dominated in soil acidification, followed by N transformations (Figure 3b). Crop BC removal by harvesting played a minor role in both paddy and upland soils, but its relative importance increased in paddy soils. The acidity input was partly neutralized by $$HCO_3$$ input from fertilizers and manure, which decreased over time due to a change from ammonia bicarbonate to urea.
