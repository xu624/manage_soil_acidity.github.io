Naturally, soil acidification is slowly driven by the net leaching of bicarbonate (HCO3) and organic acid accompanying with base cations (BC), when excess precipitation occurs. 
In croplands, application of acidifying fertilizers, especially ammonium-based (NH4) fertilizers, increases acid production via nitrification and the leaching of nitrate (NO3) along with BC. Continuous BC removal by crops also leads to soil acidification. Identifying the main drivers is essential to mitigate soil acidification.

In this topic, we calibrated the combined nutrient and soil acidification model VSD+ based on the historical changes in cropland acidification rates and their drivers for the period 1985-2019 at 151 sites, including paddy soils and upland soils, in a typical Chinese county naming Qiyang.

Results show that, in non-calcareous soils, the acidity production was mainly driven by a pH-induced reduction in HCO3 leaching and N transformations in paddy soils. In upland soils, however, acidity production was mainly driven by N transformations and hardly changed over time. In calcareous soils, HCO3 leaching dominated in soil acidification, followed by N transformations.

Crop BC removal by harvesting played a minor role in both paddy and upland soils, but its relative importance increased in paddy soils. The acidity input was partly neutralized by HCO3 input from fertilizers and manure, which decreased over time due to a change from ammonia bicarbonate to urea.
