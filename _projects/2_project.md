### INTRODUCTION
Excessive nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer use accelerates N and P losses, causing acidification in soils (by N) and eutrophication in water systems, which affect food production  and agricultural sustainability (1,2). 
Enhancing animal manure recycling to replace mineral fertilizers mitigates soil acidification and reduces N losses (3), but it may also cause undesirable P accumulation (Fig. 1). Current optimal manure recycling strategies mainly focus on minimizing acidification and N losses (4), neglecting possible undesirable P accumulation.

### METHODS
In this topic, we calibrated the VSD+ model on measured pH changes in a long-term fertilization experiment (1990-2018), in which variable amounts of inorganic N, P and potassium (K), lime (L) and organic manure (M) were applied annually to a maize-wheat rotation on red soil (Fig. 2).

### RESULTS
Scenarios were assessed to explore the future impacts of adapted nutrient management on soil acidification and nutrient surplus (Fig. 3). An optimized combination of fertilizer, manure and lime (OPT) was thus identified to minimize acidification and unnecessary P accumulation in soils, by balancing crop N, P and base cation (BC) demands and unavoidable N and BC leaching. We conclude that the VSD+ model can be used as a sustainable nutrient and acid management tool to derive optimal application rates of fertilizer, manure and lime in agricultural systems.
