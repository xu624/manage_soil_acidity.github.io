In the agricultural areas of Western Australia, more than 70% of the surface soil faces acidification problems. Lime is applied to eliminate soil acidification. It is regarded as the most economical and convenient method. Local long-term positioning experiments show that applying 1 to 2 tons of high-quality lime per hectare (15 acres) of acidic farmland can increase wheat yield by 8 to 12% on average and rapeseed by 12 to 15% on average. Limestone and dolomite powder are the most important local acidification improvement materials. About 40 agricultural input companies provide agricultural lime products of different particle sizes and purity. Farmers can use the relevant website (http://www.soilquality.org.au/) established with the participation of the Western Australian Department of Agriculture to determine the most suitable lime products based on the lime product information provided by the company, the transportation and application costs of lime, and the degree of soil acidification.
