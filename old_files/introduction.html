<h1>Welcome to a soil acidification world</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;Soils play a vital role in the Earthâ€™s ecosystem and support terrestrial life on the planet, providing 98.8% of calorie of people consumption(FAO, 2018).
    However, it was estimated that 33% of the global arable land were under moderately to highly degradation (decline in quality).
    Soil acidification ranks fifth in the global soil degradation processes.
    It was estimated that acidic soil covers 30% of ice-free land and 50% of potential croplands worldwide.

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Soil acidification is generally associated with various conditions restricting crop growth,
    including a decrease in soil fertility in terms of available phosphorus and base cations
    such as calcium, magnesium and potassium (Zhang et al., 2019) and the release of toxic aluminium and manganese under strongly acid conditions (Kochian et al., 2004).
    Furthermore, soil acidification enhances the availability of toxic heavy metals, especially lead and cadmium,
    leading to an increasingly potential risks of their accumulation in crops and animals affecting food quality and human health through the food chain (Mok et al., 2015; De Vries and McLaughlin, 2013).</p>
